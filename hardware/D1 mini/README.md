This folder contains the files required to build and assemble the D1 mini version of the board.

Contents

- `D1Mini.zip` — Gerber files for PCB fabrication (board layers, solder mask, silkscreen, drill files, etc.).
- `BOM_D1Mini.csv` — Bill of Materials: list of components, quantities and reference designators.
- `PP_D1Mini.csv` — Pick-and-place (Centroid) file used by automated assembly machines.
- `D1Mini.pdf` — Project schematic in PDF format.
- `D1Mini.png` — Project schematic as a PNG image (embedded below).

Notes

- Import the Gerber zip into your PCB manufacturer’s upload tool to produce PCBs.
- Use `BOM_D1Mini.csv` and `PP_D1Mini.csv` with your assembler or pick-and-place service.
