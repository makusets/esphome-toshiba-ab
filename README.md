# v3 is here!
v3 board is here (v2 never saw the light)

Improvements over v1:
- Works with a wide voltage range in the AB line (v1 only worked within a very narrow voltage window on the AB line), which should expand compatibility to more toshiba models.
- Much better filtering of noise and virtually no noise introduced on the AB line.
- Robust comparator design for data processing with DC filtering capacitor.

notes:

- The ESP consumes a lot more energy than the conventional wall remotes due to Wi-Fi. Therefore, the board is powered using a buck converter, as opposed to the LDO used in original Toshiba wall remote. This has the potential of introducing noise and interfere with data transmission. Through testing, I found that the specific make and model of the buck had a big impact on data corruption; as well as a good size capacitor on the 3.3v rail. This design has been tested with a DEXU branded buck and works without issues. If you test other components, please let me know what you found out.
- The DCDC buck provides 3.3V and then is fed into a 3.3V LDO, although this is counterintuitive, the LDO is needed for USB power and the model chosen allows for 3.3V input. 
- The data reading is done using DC filtering and then a comparator. The size of the DC filter capacitor is important. 
- The writing is done by pulling the A line low (to B) across a 330ohm resistor for a "0" bit, this is the same approach adopted by toshiba original board.

ESPHome component to integrate with Toshiba Air Conditioners via AB line protocol


This project implements functions to decode Toshiba AB protocol from indoor units to wired controllers and provides a hardware design to communicate.

In particular, this project has been tested with remote control unit RBC-AMT32E and RBC-AMT54E and central unit RAV-SM1103DT-A but should work with other models using the AB protocol.


Requires reader & writer circuit to interface with the AB line, connected to the remote AB ports. 
The circuit board was designed in easyEDA and all necessary files are included here.

Most of the work is based on previous work from @muxa: https://github.com/muxa/esphome-tcc-link
and the hard bits of decoding and initial board design by @issalig https://github.com/issalig/toshiba_air_cond


## To install, add or modify these sections in your esphome device yaml file

```yaml

logger:
  baud_rate: 0  #disable hardware UART log to use pins for UART communication with the AC unit 
  level: DEBUG

external_components:
  - source:
      type: git
      url: https://github.com/makusets/esphome-toshiba-ab
    refresh: 0s  #optional, how often to download fresh files from source, defaults to 1 day, use 0 to force updates 

uart:
  tx_pin: GPIO10  #GPIO15 if using v1 board
  rx_pin: GPIO13
  baud_rate: 2400
  parity: EVEN
  rx_buffer_size: 2048    # increase buffer to avoid dropped bytes

climate:
  - platform: toshiba_ab
    name: "Toshiba AC"
    id: toshiba_ac
    connected:
      name: "Toshiba AC Connected"  # optional, binary sensor that monitors link with AC
    master: 0x00 # Master ID in Toshiba protocol, optional, if omitted will go into autodetect
```

## Optional section if you install a BME280 sensor

The option of a BME280 sensor is added to give the option of reading the temperature, pressure and humidity from the thermostat. It is done as any other sensor in the ESPHome environment. If configured, it will be exposed to the frontend. If you want to use this or another sensor to control the AC system, have a look at the complete_exmple.yaml file. 

```yaml
# If installed, it will report the BME280 temp, humidity and pressure values

i2c:
  sda: GPIO2
  scl: GPIO14
  scan: True


sensor:
  - platform: bme280_i2c
    temperature:
      name: "Indoor Temperature"
      id: bme_temp
      oversampling: 1x
    pressure:
      name: "Indoor Pressure"
      id: bme_pressure
      accuracy_decimals: 0
      oversampling: 1x
    humidity:
      name: "Indoor Humidity"
      id: bme_humidity
      accuracy_decimals: 0
      oversampling: 2x
    address: 0x76
    update_interval: 30s
    
```

# Hardware installation

You will need to build the esphome compatible hardware. Instructions below.

- Most likely, the first time, you will have to flash the board with the firmware via USB, typical ESPHome process. Once working, OTA updates will work.

- Isolate the AC unit completely off (at the electrical distribution board ideally)
- Take out the cover of your remote controller
- Loose the screws of AB terminals. 
- Wire the remote A,B terminals to the pcb. V1 board is polarity sensitive. V3 board can be connected both ways.

# Hardware design

This is the schematic of the V3 board, it is powered by the AB line

It should look something like that

I2C headers have been added for the BME280 I2C sensor option, also for future inclusion of a screen or other I2C device
If a BME280 sensor is installed and setup in yaml it will report the readings to HA

All files necessary can be found in the hardware folder, including the EasyEDA Project:

# More options and complete yaml

Have a look at the complete_example.yaml file for more options available for the component. It includes details about reporting a chosen temperature to the AC central unit or reading extra sensors (power, pressure, runtime, temp...)
